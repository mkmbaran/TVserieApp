# TV Show Application

A simple Java Spring Boot application that reads src/main/resources/tvserier.txt and queries each retrieved show to tvmazemap.com/api to retrieve more information about the show, and then saves it to a local MySQL database.

The application runs on localhost:8080

SQL schema can be found in testdb.sql
